                        <p>In a world of million possibilities we live in today the challenge we confront is not about finding the right path of human evolution. The paths are already being discovered as everyday technology is bringing in promises of a tomorrow with greater possibilities. In the wake of Industrial Revolution 4.O, rather than discovering, it is more about choosing the right path.</p>
                        <p>With the Rise of technologies like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Genetic Engineering, Big Data, Blockchain, etc. We have a great opportunity to manoeuvre our efforts in direction of decisions entailing a higher Social Value, which have the potential to solve not merely the convenience challenges, but rather the ever lingering challenges of human establishment like Inequality, Injustice, Poverty, Health and Happiness indeed.</p>
                        <p>With the dawn of quantum age, it will be imperative to ensure the perfect harmony between evolution in technology and human wisdom and this is where we establish ourselves as mediators of a better world.</p>
