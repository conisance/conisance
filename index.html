                        <p>In a world of million possibilities we live in today the challenge we confront is not about finding the right path of human evolution. The paths are already being discovered as everyday technology is bringing in promises of a tomorrow with greater possibilities. In the wake of Industrial Revolution 4.O, rather than discovering, it is more about choosing the right path.</p>
                        <p>With the Rise of technologies like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Genetic Engineering, Big Data, Blockchain, etc. We have a great opportunity to manoeuvre our efforts in direction of decisions entailing a higher Social Value, which have the potential to solve not merely the convenience challenges, but rather the ever lingering challenges of human establishment like Inequality, Injustice, Poverty, Health and Happiness indeed.</p>
                        <p>With the dawn of quantum age, it will be imperative to ensure the perfect harmony between evolution in technology and human wisdom and this is where we establish ourselves as mediators of a better world.</p>

                        We are dedicated to providing an enjoyable, respectful and harassment-free event experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks.

                        We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form and we expect all participants to conduct themselves in a professional and appropriate manner. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event, without a refund, at the discretion of the event organisers.

                        Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

                        Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

                        If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

                        We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social events.
                        Emergency contact details

                        Cookies policy
                        </b><br>

                        1. What are cookies?
                        1.1. What are cookies and why are they important for user experience?

                        This website uses cookies.

                        Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.

                        Cookies do lots of different and useful jobs, such as letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences. They help us understand how our website is used and improve your online experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

                        2. What type of cookies do we use?
                        2.1 Which cookies are used by us?

                        Most of the cookies we use are session cookies, which are automatically deleted from your hard disk at the end of the browser session. Session cookies are needed to help the website function.

                        In addition to these we also use longer-term cookies that stay on your hard disk. On a subsequent visit it is then automatically recognised that you have previously visited us, and we know which input and settings you prefer. These cookies are stored on your hard disk and are automatically deleted after 30 days. They make our website more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. These cookies make it possible for us to show you information that is relevant to you. The sole purpose of these cookies is to adapt our content to your needs as well as to make browsing our pages as enjoyable as possible.

                        2.2 What data is stored in the cookies?

                        Only pseudonymous data is stored in our cookies. On activation, the cookie is allocated an identification number; we do not allocate personal data to this identification number. Your name, your IP address and other such data that might allow the cookie to be traced to you directly are not stored in the cookie. We receive only aggregated information, relating for example to which of our pages have been visited, which products were viewed, etc.

                        2.3 What is onsite targeting?

                        Data is collected on our website using cookies for optimisation of our advertising and of the entire online experience. This data is not used to identify you personally but solely serves the purpose of conducting a pseudonymous evaluation of the use made of our pages. With this technology we can present advertising, special offers and services to you, the content of which is based on information obtained from a connection to click-stream analysis (for example, advertising that is based on the fact that during the past few days only you have viewed a specific page). Our aim here is to make our offers as relevant to you as possible and to present advertising that corresponds to your areas of interest.

                        2.4 Are there also cookies from third-party suppliers (so-called “third-party cookies”)?

                        We makes use of a number of web partners, for example, Google Analytics, Facebook and Doubleclick who help to make our websites more interesting for you. This is why, when visiting our websites, the cookies of these companies may also be stored on your hard disk. These cookies are deleted automatically after a pre-specified period. The cookies of our partner companies also contain solely pseudonymous or anonymous aggregated data. This relates, for example, to data on which pages you have looked at, whether anything was bought or a signup occurred, among other actions. Here, some of our advertising partners also collect information from our websites on which pages you have previously visited in order to be able to show you advertising that best complies with your interests.

                        2.5 Retargeting

                        Our websites make use of so-called re-targeting technologies. We use these technologies to make our offering more interesting for you. Retargeting allows users who have already shown an interest in our events to also be provided with suitable advertising on the websites of our partners. The use of personalised, interest-oriented advertising is generally more interesting for users than advertising that has no such personal customisation. The use of this advertising approach by our partners is undertaken on the basis of a cookie technology and an analysis of previous utilisation behaviour. This form of advertising is completely pseudonymous. On using our sites, cookies are deployed and thereby usage data is collected from you, stored and utilised. Your data is furthermore stored in cookies beyond the end of the browser session so that it can be called up again on your next visits to the websites.
                        2.6 How can you prevent the storage of cookies?

                        In your browser you can enable a setting that storage of cookies is only permissible when you agree to it, and thereby prevent the further storage of cookies in the future. You can modify cookie settings from your respective browsers' settings menu.
                        You can obtain up-to-date information about blocking and deleting cookies via these links:

                        3. Log Files

                        With each visit to our website, usage data is transmitted by the respective Internet browser and is stored in record files, the so-called server log files. The records stored in this way contain data on date and time of the call-up, name of the page called up, IP address, referrer URL (URL of origin, from which you came to the websites), and the quantities of data transferred, product information and the version of the browser used. These log file data records are evaluated by us, to help us further improve our websites, as well as to make our pages more user-friendly, to detect and correct errors more quickly and to control server capacities. We also use log file data records to defend our site against attacks, e.g. in the context of DDOS attacks, which are intended to block access to our site by overloading it with enquiries.

                        4. Web analysis

                        In order to continuously improve and optimise our offers, we make use of tracking technologies. For this purpose, we enlist the services of Google Analytics.
                        4.1 Google Analytics

                        This website makes use of Google (Universal) Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc. (www.google.com). Google (Universal) Analytics deploys methods that make it possible to analyse the use made of the website by you, e.g. the so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are stored on your computer. The information generated on your use of this website is transmitted, as a rule, to a Google server in the USA and stored there. By activating the IP-anonymise function on this website the IP address is shortened, within the member countries of the European Union or in other contracting states that were party to the agreement on the European Economic Area, before further transfer. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. The anonymised IP address transferred by your browser within the framework of Google Analytics is not brought together with other Google data.

                        You can prevent the acquisition of the data generated by the cookie relating to your use of the website (incl. your IP address) by Google, as well as its processing by Google, if you download and install the browser plug-in available here. As an alternative to the browser plug-in, you can click this link in order to prevent recording by Google Analytics on this website in the future. In this case, an opt-out cookie will be placed in your terminal device. Please note that on deleting all cookies on your computer, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted, i.e. if you still want to prevent anonymised data acquisition by Google Analytics you will have to reset the opt-out cookie once again. The opt-out cookie is set for each browser and computer. If you visit our websites from home and from your place of work, or with different browsers, you will have to activate the opt-out cookie in the various browsers or on different computers.

We may also need to retain some of your information for a longer period to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our Terms of Service.
                         
                        8. Data transfers
                        As a global business, we access and transfer information around the world. If you are based in the EU, this means that we access and transfer your personal information outside the EU, including in and to the United States. The privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in some of these countries may not be the same as in your home country. We transfer your personal information in accordance with law, and take steps to ensure that your information is appropriately protected.
                        In particular, where we transfer information to countries that are not viewed as providing adequate protections, we generally rely on an approved mechanism known as the “standard contractual clauses” to protect the information transferred. These are template contracts published by the European Commission containing approved commitments to protect the privacy and security of the information transferred.
                         
                        9. Your rights
                        You have a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited cases. We describe these rights below. 
                        9.1 Access and Porting. You can access much of your information by logging into your Event profile. If you require access to additional information, or you do not have an Event profile, please contact us. Where legally required, we will provide your information in an easily accessible format and assist in transferring some of this information to third parties.
                        9.2 Rectify, Restrict, Delete. You can amend, update and delete some of your information by logging into your Event profile. If you don’t have an Event profile, or want us to amend, update or delete other information, please contact us.
                        9.3 Object. Where we process your information based on the legitimate interests described above, or in the public interest, you can object to the processing in certain circumstances. We will generally stop processing your information unless we have compelling grounds to continue processing, such as where needed for legal reasons. Where we use your information for direct marketing, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such communications, changing your profile settings or by contacting us. Where we inform you that we will record a call to you, we will provide you with the opportunity to object to such recording. 
                        9.4 Revoke consent. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. For example, if we ask for your consent for direct marketing purposes, you can revoke your consent using the unsubscribe link in such communications, changing your profile settings or by contacting us.
                        9.5 Complain. If you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so. You can contact us or your local supervisory authority.
                         
                        10. Security
                        The security of your personal information is important to us. We strive to use appropriate technical and organisational to protect your personal information.

                        11. Children
